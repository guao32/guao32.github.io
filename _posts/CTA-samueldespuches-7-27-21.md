As I've started to use computational text analysis (CTA) tools, one thing is apparent to me:
I could never do what the computer does, and it could never do what I can. I think it's 
a stretch to say that CTA can replace human analysis, and here's why... The computer can
only lead to calculated guesses about the text, however it can't be too precise. 
For example, if we were to score the "overall happiness" of Johnathan Pearson throughout 
the years, based on how often "happy" words appear in his diary, we would find patterns
that indicate when he was happiest in his lifetime. This is but a calculated guess, 
because who's to say that in a certain period, he liked saying that he was "not happy" 
instead of "sad". The computer might interpret the word "happy" on its own, and give us
wrong results. CTA is a powerful supplement to reading that would be foolish to ignore
in academic research.
