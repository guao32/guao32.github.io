## Getting acquainted with Digital Humanities

After having wrapped up our first week of the Summer IDEaS project, my main takeaway is
understanding what digital humanities are and why they're useful. That is, using
technological tools to make scholarly resources available in interactive ways.
There may be more to reading a book; images, notes, maps, graphs and many other
tools can be incorporated in digital editions. This is exciting because it gives the 
potential to the reader to go deeper than before in their research. 
My job is to make this resource available to future scholars. Mine is a small contribution 
to the fast-growing digital library of human knowledge, an accomplishment that we'll
keep building on for generations to come.
