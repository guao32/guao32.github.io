## Digital humanities are for all
In the second week of our program, we kept exploring resources and options for our 
research. We started thinking about copyright for our digital edition of Pearson's Diary.
The spirit of digital humanities is to share with others, to contribute to our 
collection of knowledge. I fully support and adhere to that spirit, so me and my team 
decided to go with an open license, which should make it easy for future researchers 
to build upon our work with little complication. All we'll get in return is credit.

## Digitization
Becky Fried, a librarian here, took us in her world of digitization. Using expensive
machinery, and extensive conservation practices for archival objects such as books 
or pictures, she scans and uploads these to a digital archive. I find this work intriguing;
in the arch of mankind's history, this is such a big and memorable step. History itself
starts thousands of years ago when someone decided to write down how much in taxes the
inhabitants of their village needed to pay. The next steps include using paper, inventing 
alphabets, and eventually collecting knowledge in libraries. For thousands of years
people such as monks kept passing on writing to preserve our knowledge until the
printing press was invented. That will be the last great invention before what's happening
now. We are in the process of creating the greatest collection ever, that seems to 
also be the safest in its test through time. So exciting!
