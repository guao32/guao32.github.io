## Find what you need
I was introduced to a new research tool called "Voyant", a software that can do quick
text analyses in various ways. Word searches, word counts, and visualisations appear 
immediately after a quick search, among other things. This allows to make quick inferences 
about any text, that would be impossible to make even having read the text thoroughly.
Here are some examples...

## Trends
With the Pearson diary in mind, one might wonder what he talked about, what his passions 
were, who he loved and when he was happy or sad. Using the Trends tool in Voyant, I was 
able to make a quick visualisation of the question "Was he a happy or sad man?".

The visualisation infers that in his earlier years he was happy, but as he approached old
age he became more and more sad. Obviously this can't be conclusive, as there are many
other words he might have used to describe his happiness that didn't make it in this 
graph, but it's a starting point for research.

## Context
Another great tool is called "Context". It allows to search for terms in the text. When 
the software finds the term, it shows you several phrases before and after the word, to 
put it in context. This allowed me to find some interesting quotes by Pearson. 
I decided to search the word "sex", and to my surprise found a quote about homosexuals.
I was surprised by my findings because I didn't expect him to confront the subject, and 
to have the position he does on it. Given the historical period, his religious belief 
and his values, I expected him to be more conservative on the matter.

A simple search gave me a new perspective on my subject of research that I might have 
missed since I haven't read the whole text.
